// Asynchronous Content!

// Servers!

// They reply to a specific request

// Make sure:
// - Encoding is set up properly, you should always utf-8
// - Every connection is a two way street between client and server
// - No other client can come in on that street
// - If we want to interact with multiple clients, we will have to store them outside the server
// -- Make sure to manage that data properly

// - Don't forget that you can build your blocks separately
