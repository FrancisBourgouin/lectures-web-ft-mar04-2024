### Weekend recap

### What is a database

- Where you store data
- Place for data

### Why do we want to use a DBMS ?

Database vs Object in TinyApp

In memory database vs Persistent database

Redis => High performance in memory database (if turned off, we technically all data)
PostgreSQL => High performance persistent database (if turned off, we don't lose anything) (Costly CPU/Storage/RAM)

fs.writeFile + JSON => Write order


Client - Application - Data

DBMS => Database Management Server / Service


Client / Server relationship

Client => PSQL
Server => PostgreSQL


Database interactions are like programming, but simpler

- Create data
- Read data
- Update data
- Delete data

CRUD

Database design => From a google sheet/excel to a database


## SQL

- SELECT
  - Specific columns and aliases with (column_name AS something_else)
  - Filter with WHERE and AND
  - Filter with WHERE for strings with the LIKE operator (enables %)
  - Order elements in an ascending order or descending with (ORDER BY column ASC / DESC)
